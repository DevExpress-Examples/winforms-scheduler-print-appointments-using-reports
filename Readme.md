# WinForms Scheduler - Use DevExpress Reports to print appointments

This example uses [DevExpress Reports](https://www.devexpress.com/subscriptions/reporting/) to print user appointments.

The key point is to obtain a collection of appointments and assign it to the report's [DataSource](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReportBase.DataSource) property. The example uses the [GetAppointments](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.SchedulerDataStorage.GetAppointments.overloads) method to obtain appointments that fall within the time range specified by the [GetVisibleIntervals](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.SchedulerViewBase.GetVisibleIntervals) method.

To display custom fields in the report, the example exposes [custom fields](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/17137/controls-and-libraries/scheduler/data-binding/mappings/custom-fields) (see the `Task` class). The [SetAppointmentFactory](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.AppointmentStorageBase.SetAppointmentFactory(DevExpress.XtraScheduler.IAppointmentFactory)) method replaces Scheduler Appointment objects with `Task` class instances.

> **Important**

> You should own a [DevExpress Reporting](https://www.devexpress.com/buy/net/) license.
